# Demo Helper Configs

This is a series of config snippets that may be useful to add to configuration
playlists specific to demonstration or training deployments.

Variations from a live deployment may be required to support a demo environment.

The best example is the admin timeout set to a low value in a live NGFW but
useful to have at much higher values to avoid constant login during a demo.
